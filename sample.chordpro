Verse:

You crossed the great divide, You took our place
You offered up Your life, though we have failed
[F]The veil was torn and l[A#min9]ove remained
You are h[C]oly Lo[G]rd
[F]Distraction cast as[Am]ide, we seek Your face
[F]We offer up our l[Am]ives to bring You praise (sample special characters)
[F]A love the walls cann[Am]ot contain
You are h[C]oly Lo[G]rd
