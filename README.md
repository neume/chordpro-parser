# Chordpro Parser
An attempt to rewrite chordproko gem in C++. It should be portable to any device that can run or compile this project.

This program outputs XML or YML files.

## Ruby Gem
A wrapper ruby gem will follow after a working prototype or release candidate is published and soon will be utilized in an existing
`chordproko` gem.

## TODOs
+ Analyzer
+ Parser
+ Tests
